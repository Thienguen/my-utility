## util

Personal utility for C/C++ projects, as generic as possible, so it can be used in any projects. (aoc, maybe)

## usefulScript - python

I wish I have this when I was in my sophomore year, why sophomore? I can't even install mingw when I was in freshmen

### fileKind

> **Brief:** In that folder, make all designated file to have a indent of 4 and replace CRLF end-of-line sequences with LF. C/C++, it is a good habit to use 4 spaces as a indent, and LF as a end-of-line sequence. Also remove trailning spaces.

### fileKind2

> **Brief:** In that folder, make all designated file to have a indent of 2 and replace CRLF end-of-line sequences with LF, and remove all trailing spaces. When I do front-end. I use 2 spaces as a indent, and LF as a end-of-line sequence.

### iterationOfInput

> **Brief:** Depends on projects with multiple input files, this script can help you to iterate all input files and output the result to a designated file or simplpy run the program multiple time with different input files, output can be direct to a file, or terminal.

### renameFiles

> **Brief:** Tbh, this things can be so powerful for me as a lazy weeb, I can rename all my anime files with this script, and I can also use this to rename all my homework files, so I don't have to do it manually.

### createTxtFile

> **Brief:** The script then gets the current working directory using os.getcwd() and calls the create_in_txt_files function on it. This will cause the function to be called on the current working directory and all of its subdirectories, creating an "in.txt" file in each subdirectory.

### passwordGenerator

> **Brief:** This script will generate a random password for you, and you can also specify the length of the password, well...shit is more useless than I thought.
